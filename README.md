# instagram_username_checker
Checks the availability of shortest usernames on Instagram without searching limits.
You can also use this script to check your custom list of usernames.

# How to use -
1. To check the shortest available usernames, run the un_generator.py file, which simply generates all the possible combinations of 2 and 3 character words and store them into usernames.csv and usernames3.csv files.

2. If you want to check the availability of your custom list of usernames, just replace the data in any of the csv file with your usernames.

3. Run checker.py file to test all usernames in csv files, and the available usernames are stored into a new file with name available.txt.
